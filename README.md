Apex - Overview 

Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers 
to execute flow and transaction control statements on the Lightning platform server in 
conjunction with calls to the Lightning Platformâ€‹ API. Using syntax that looks like Java 
and acts like database stored procedures, Apex enables developers to add business logic 
to most system events, including button clicks, related record updates, and Visualforce pages.
Apex code can be initiated by Web service requests and from triggers on objects.
