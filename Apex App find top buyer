//To create a Salesforce app to find the top buyer in Salesforce data, you would typically use Salesforce's Apex programming language.
Here's an example of how you might implement this: //


// Have Fun - Daniel 

// Apex class to find the top buyer
public class TopBuyerFinder {
    
    // Method to find the top buyer
    public static List<Contact> findTopBuyer() {
        // Query to find contacts with the highest total purchase amount
        List<Contact> topBuyers = [SELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunities) FROM Contact ORDER BY (SELECT SUM(Amount) FROM Opportunities) DESC LIMIT 1];
        
        return topBuyers;
    }
}
